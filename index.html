                <p>The 9/11 Memorial is bounded by Fulton Street to the North, West Street to the West, Greenwich Street to the East, and Liberty Street to the South. It is located directly adjacent to the One World Trade Center, the tallest building within New York City. Amidst some of the most treasured highrises within NYC, the 9/11 Memorial is unique in that it is mostly a flat area.</p>

                <p>The American flag appeared again and again throughout the memorial. Of course, this makes sense. 9/11 was one of the great tragedies in American history. However, what was surprising is that within the 9/11 memorial itself, there were chatters in what sounded like Spanish, Arabic, Russian, Hindi/Urdu, French, and Chinese. Such diversity is definitely representative of the people of New York, and there was artwork along the walls of the nearby World Trade Center subway station that echoed these sentiments.</p>

                <p>A lot of the people in the area were definitely tourists. People were lining up for photos in front of the nearby buildings. The architecture of the Perelman Performing Arts Center, Oculus, and the 9/11 Memorial were indeed mesmerizing, and they were some of the more popular spots for pictures. The main attractions, however, were definitely the two pools to commemorate the two towers that fell. There is a sizable barrier to ensure that nobody attempts to jump into the pool or anything of that nature. The names of the innocent people who lost their lives day is engraved into the barrier to honor their legacy. Though not obvious at first, the organization of the names is not at all random. Instead, the <a href="https://www.911memorial.org/visit/memorial/about-memorial">9/11 Memorial</a> reveals that the names exist in “meaningful adjacencies.” The family members of those who died were able to request the names be engraved alongside specific others. Overall, this allowed the majority of the names to appear alongside the names of others who were close to them.</p>

                <p>It was 70 degrees on a Saturday afternoon when I went, so it is no surprise that there were a lot of people. However, despite the number of people there, it still felt far less packed than somewhere like Times Square. Given that the area serves as a place of tribute and mourning, the atmosphere was relatively tranquil for a major city. There wasn’t a lot of noise or loud music. People were indeed very respectful of the severity of what happened on 9/11. The sound of the waterfall within the pool was enough to wash away the majority of the chatter that was taking place. <a href="https://www.911memorial.org/visit/memorial/about-memorial">According to the 9/11 Memorial</a>, the waterfall within the pools is the largest manmade waterfall within North America. There is a void in the middle of the pool where all of the water is directed into, but the void never fills up. This is meant to be symbolic of the void left in the hearts of many Americans since the attacks on 9/11.</p>

                <p> The area itself was very pedestrian friendly. There were these retractable plows that blocked unauthorized vehicles from stepping into the area. This emptied out the streets near the 9/11 memorial, and pedestrians had freedom to walk on both the sidewalks and the streets. It is important to note that pedestrians were technically meant to stay on the sidewalks. There were signs informing pedestrians to avoid walking on the streets, but these rules were sparsely followed because of the lack of vehicles. There were police patrolling the area, however, most of this was done on foot instead of in a vehicle. I saw an officer walking around with a guard dog as well as people who looked like they were employees of the park. Another thing to note was that I didn’t see a bike the entire time I was there. Although bikes were technically allowed in some parts of the area, it seemed like the bikers preferred to take alternative paths instead of biking through the 9/11 memorial directly.  </p>

                <p> Aside from pedestrians walking in places they weren’t meant to walk on, the majority of the rules set by the 9/11 memorial were respected. There were many rules plastered across the park (e.g. places where people were asked not to sit, lawns where people couldn’t stand on, and activities people were asked not to do), and most people followed such rules. There was this quiet area between the One World Trade Center and the Perelman Performing Arts Center where people could sit down and do some work (Bloomberg Plaza). The area was named in honor of the former mayor for his leadership in post 9/11 times. They had tables as well in case anyone wanted to eat some food or drink some coffee, but people used the area most to just sit down and gossip with friends and family. Additionally, there were these stone blocks that had a dual purpose. They were placed in a way where they could act as decor, but they were also the perfect height for sitting down within the 9/11 memorial itself. Aside from Bloomberg Plaza, these stone blocks were the only other place where people could sit down within the memorial.</p>

                <p>There were also a handful of souvenir shops in the area. At first, I was wondering what sort of merchandise one could really sell without being disrespectful to what took place on 9/11. However, upon a closer look, the merchandise they were selling was mostly honoring the NYPD and FDNY for the first-responders that lost their lives that day.</p>

                <p>Another theme within the park were oak trees. <a href="https://www.911memorial.org/connect/blog/first-about-400-swamp-white-oak-trees-are-being-planted-911-memorials-plaza-updated-x4">According to the 9/11 memorial</a>, there are over 400 oak trees in the Memorial plaza. The species of oak trees that they chose to use is native to all three places where there were crashes on 9/11 (Arlington, Virginia; Somerset County Pennsylvania; and New York City). </p>
                
                <p>The overall atmosphere within the memorial was definitely one of respect, peace, and tranquility. The memorial acts as a public place that not only honors the lives that were lost on 9/11, but also one that promotes a sense of peace and unity among New Yorkers. Of course, the area will always have solemn vibes filling the air because of the sheer scale of the tragedy that took place. However, I couldn’t help but feel a wave of optimism and patriotism while leaving the area. Memorial Plaza definitely highlights some of the best characteristics of what it means to be an American, and surveying the area was more than enjoyable.</p>
